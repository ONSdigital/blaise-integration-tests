Feature: Import Nisra cases
	In order to process cases gathered online
	As a service
	I want to be given cases to import representing the data captured online

#Scenario 1 https://collaborate2.ons.gov.uk/confluence/display/QSS/Blaise+5+NISRA+Case+Processor+Flow
Scenario: A case in the NISRA file is complete and in Blaise it is complete, we take the NISRA case
	Given there is a Nisra file that contains a case that is complete
	And the same case exists in Blaise that is complete
	When the nisra file is processed
	Then the existing blaise case is overwritten with the NISRA case

#Scenario 2 https://collaborate2.ons.gov.uk/confluence/display/QSS/Blaise+5+NISRA+Case+Processor+Flow
Scenario:  A case in the NISRA file is partially complete and in Blaise it is complete, we keep the existing blaise case
	Given there is a Nisra file that contains a case that is partially complete
	And the same case exists in Blaise that is complete
	When the nisra file is processed
	Then the existing blaise case is kept

#Scenario 3 https://collaborate2.ons.gov.uk/confluence/display/QSS/Blaise+5+NISRA+Case+Processor+Flow
Scenario: A case in the NISRA file is complete and in Blaise it is partially complete, we take the NISRA case
	Given there is a Nisra file that contains a case that is complete
	And the same case exists in Blaise that is partially complete
	When the nisra file is processed
	Then the existing blaise case is overwritten with the NISRA case

#Scenario 4 https://collaborate2.ons.gov.uk/confluence/display/QSS/Blaise+5+NISRA+Case+Processor+Flow
Scenario Outline: A case in the NISRA file is complete and in Blaise it is between the range 210-542, we take the NISRA case
	Given there is a Nisra file that contains a case that is complete
	And the same case exists in Blaise with the outcome code '<existingOutcome>'
	When the nisra file is processed
	Then the existing blaise case is overwritten with the NISRA case
	Examples: 
	| existingOutcome | description                                                 |
	| 210             | Partially completed survey                                  |
	| 310             | Non-contact                                                 |
	| 430             | HQ refusal                                                  |
	| 440             | Person not available                                        |
	| 460             | Refuses cooperation - hard refusal                          |
	| 461             | Refuses cooperation - soft refusal could be contacted again |
	| 541             | Language difficulties - notified by Head Office             |
	| 542             | Language difficulties - notified to interviewer             |

#Scenario 5 https://collaborate2.ons.gov.uk/confluence/display/QSS/Blaise+5+NISRA+Case+Processor+Flow
